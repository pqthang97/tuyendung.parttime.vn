                                 Businesses should actively review all their job offers, checking, sorting and contacting candidates who have applied and are of interest. By "actively" we consider: 1) viewing the full profile of candidates that have applied to the offer, 2) process candidates (ie moving them to the "Approved", "Rejected" or "Interesting" status), 3) getting in touch with candidates through our messaging system;

                                 if there has been no activity within 72 hours from time of publication of the job, we may analyse the reasons for such inactivity to assess the possibility of closing the account. If this inactivity is repeated in a second process, we will close the account;

                                 it is recommended that Businesses maintain conversation via our messaging system with interested candidates. These conversations can in no case motivate the candidate to continue the recruitment or engagement process other than through us;

In order to ensure that JTW can verify the time spent by any one temporary worker in the performance of the relevant Assignment, the Client must submit a time sheet for each temporary worker via the time sheet function of the App or through such other method as may be specified by JTW (the <strong>"Time Sheet Deadline"</strong>).

                           The Client cannot decline to submit a time sheet because the Client is not satisfied with the qualifications, experience or work performed by the relevant temporary worker.  If the Client is not satisfied with the abilities or performance of a temporary worker, the Client must notify JTW immediately, via the process specified by JTW explaining why the Client is not satisfied, so it can be considered by JTW's client service team.

No temporary workers supplied to the Client are obliged to take holiday, but if they do, the Client must permit such temporary worker to take holiday in accordance with the Client's own company policy.
